The Profane Earth is an attempt to redefine poetry in the 21st century.
How is one to think of, write, and conceptualize poetry when the medium is now so profoundly different?
 How is one to redeploy and recreate poetic worlds and experiences while not just adding words to a multimedia platform, nor changing the poetic experience so much that nothing remains?
This is my attempt to explore these questions.
    
    I think of poems as environments, even, and mostly, when I write them. Using words, I try to create, within the reader’s mind, an aesthetic experience that creates an emotional landscape.
Words, to me, are tools to push perception and meaning into new arrangements and new conflicts out of which unusual poignant environments may rise.
    
    Thanks to virtual reality, I can now truly explore these concepts.
    
    I hope you will enjoy the experience
    
    These virtual worlds use poems taken from
